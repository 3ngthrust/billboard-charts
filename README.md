============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guoguo12/billboard-charts.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/guoguo12/billboard-charts)

**billboard.py** is a Python API for accessing ranking charts from Billboard.com.

Installation
------------

To install with pip, run

```
pip install billboard.py
```

You can also clone this repository and run `python setup.py install`.

Quickstart
----------

To download a *Billboard* chart, we use the `ChartData()` constructor.

Let's fetch the current [Hot 100](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) chart.

```Python
>>> import billboard
>>> chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100')
```

Now we can look at the chart entries, which are of type `ChartEntry` and have attributes like `artist` and `title`:

```Python
>>> song = chart[0]  # Get no. 1 song on chart
>>> song.title       # Get the title
u'Hello'
>>> song.artist      # Get the artist
u'Adele'
>>> song.weeks       # Get number of weeks on chart
4
```

We can also easily pretty-print the entire chart with:

```Python
print chart
```

which as of 29 November 2015 gives:

```
hot-100 chart (current)
-----------------------
1. 'Hello' by Adele (0)
2. 'Sorry' by Justin Bieber (+1)
3. 'Hotline Bling' by Drake (-1)
4. 'Love Yourself' by Justin Bieber (Hot Shot Debut)
5. 'What Do You Mean?' by Justin Bieber (+1)
6. 'The Hills' by The Weeknd (-2)
7. 'Stitches' by Shawn Mendes (-2)

### Downloading a chart

Use the `ChartData` constructor to download a chart:

```Python
ChartData(name, date=None, fetch=True, all=False)
```

The arguments are:

* `name` &ndash; The chart name, e.g. `'hot-100'` or `'pop-songs'`. You can browse the Charts section of Billboard.com to find valid chart names; the URL of a chart will look like `http://www.billboard.com/charts/CHART-NAME` ([example](http://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100)).
* `date` &ndash; The chart date as a string, in YYYY-MM-DD format. If this argument is omitted (or is `None`), the latest chart will be fetched. Again, the best way to find valid dates is by browsing the Billboard website. For the Hot 100 chart, an example of a valid date is `'2015-11-28'`, which gets [this chart](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2015-11-28). If this argument is invalid, no exception will be raised; instead, the chart will contain no entries.
* `fetch` &ndash; A boolean indicating whether to fetch the chart data from Billboard.com immediately (at instantiation time). If `False`, the chart data can be populated at a later time using the `fetchEntries()` method.
* `all` &ndash; Deprecated; has no effect.

### Walking through chart dates

Every `ChartData` instance has a `previousDate` attribute containing a string representation of the previous chart's date. You can feed this into another `ChartData` instance to effectively walk back through previous charts.

```python
from time import sleep

import billboard

chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100')
while chart.previousDate:
    doSomething(chart)
    chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100', chart.previousDate)
    sleep(2)  # Throttle requests
``` 

### Accessing chart entries

If `chart` is a `ChartData` instance, we can ask for its `entries` attribute to get the chart entries (see below) as a list.

For convenience, `chart[x]` is equivalent to `chart.entries[x]`, and `ChartData` instances are iterable.

### Chart entry attributes

A chart entry (typically a single track) is of type `ChartEntry`. A `ChartEntry` instance has the following attributes:

* `title` &ndash; The title of the track.
* `artist` &ndash; The name of the artist, as formatted on Billboard.com. If there are multiple artists and/or featured artists, they will all be included in this string.
* `peakPos` &ndash; The track's peak position on the chart, as an int.
* `lastPos` &ndash; The track's position on the previous week's chart, as an int. This value is 0 if the track has never been on the chart before.
* `weeks` &ndash; The number of weeks the track has been on the chart. This value is 1 if the track is new on the chart.
* `rank` &ndash; The track's current position on the chart.
* `change` &ndash; A string indicating how the track's position has changed since the previous week. This may be one of the following:
  * A signed integer like +4, -1, or 0, indicating the difference between the track's current position and its position on the previous week's chart.
  * 'Hot Shot Debut', which means track is the highest-rated track that is completely new to the chart.
  * 'New', which means the track is completely new to the chart, yet not the highest rated new track.
  * 'Re-Entry', which means the track is re-entering the chart after leaving it for at least a week.
* `spotifyID` &ndash; The Spotify ID of the track, or an empty string if it was not provided. This can be used to access more information about the track via the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-tr ack/).
* `spotifyLink` &ndash; The Spotify embed URL of the track, generated from the spotifyID. Will be an empty string if no such ID was provided.

Pull requests are welcome! Please adhere to the following style guidelines:

* In general, follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You may ignore E501 ("line too long") and E127 ("continuation line over-indented for visual indent") if following them would detract from the readability of the code. Use your best judgement!
* We use `mixedCase` for variable names.
* All-uppercase words remain all-uppercase when they appear at the end of variable names (e.g. `downloadHTML` not `downloadHtml`).

### Running tests

Install [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

To run all of the tests, run

```
nosetests
```

Assuming you have both Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on your machine, you can also run

```
tox
```

to run tests on both versions; see `tox.ini` for configuration details.
